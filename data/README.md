# Data Folder

This folder should contain the ENGIE datasets:

- engie_X.csv (sensor features)
- engie_Y.csv (target power values)

⚠️ The actual CSV files are NOT stored in the repository because they are too large.
They must be uploaded locally or accessed via Google Drive when running the notebooks.
